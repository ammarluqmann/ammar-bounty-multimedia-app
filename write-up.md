1. Description of the Two Features:

a) Search Bar:
The search bar feature allows users to search for specific files within the Multimedia Web App. Users can enter keywords in the search bar, and the app will filter the displayed files based on the entered keywords. The search is case-insensitive, meaning it will match files regardless of their letter casing.

b) Filter:
The filter feature enables users to filter the displayed files based on their types (video, audio, document, or image). By clicking on the corresponding filter buttons, users can narrow down the files to show only those of a specific type. The "All" button shows all file types without any filtering.

2. Explanation of Feature Choices and Appropriateness:
The search bar and filter features are appropriate additions to the Multimedia Web App because they enhance the user experience and make it easier for users to navigate and find files. These features address two common needs of users:

a) Search Capability: As the number of files in the app grows, finding a specific file becomes more challenging. The search bar allows users to quickly locate files by searching for keywords present in the file names. It saves time and effort that would otherwise be spent scrolling through a long list of files.

b) File Type Filtering: Different file types may require different actions or have distinct visual representations. By providing filter options, users can easily focus on specific types of files they are interested in. For example, if a user wants to view only videos or audio files, they can select the corresponding filter to refine the displayed files.

3. Explanation of How the Code Works:
a) Search Bar:

The search bar functionality is implemented using the searchKeyword state variable and the handleSearchChange function.
The searchKeyword state variable stores the current value of the search input field.
The handleSearchChange function is called whenever the search input value changes. It updates the searchKeyword state variable with the new value.
The filteredFiles variable uses the filter method on the myFiles array to create a new array that contains only files whose names include the searchKeyword.
The filtered files are further refined based on the active filter (file type) selected by the user.
b) Filter:

The filter functionality is implemented using the activeFilter state variable and the handleFilterChange function.
The activeFilter state variable stores the currently selected filter option ("all", "video", "audio", "document", "image").
The handleFilterChange function is called when a filter button is clicked. It updates the activeFilter state variable with the selected filter option.
The filtered files are displayed based on the active filter. If the active filter is set to "all", all files are shown. Otherwise, the files are filtered based on their types using the filter method on the filteredFiles array.
Overall, the code updates the displayed files based on the search keyword and active filter. It provides users with a convenient way to search for files and filter them based on their types, improving the usability of the Multimedia Web App.
